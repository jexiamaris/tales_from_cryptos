# Tales from the Crypto
This project analyzed the public sentiment around Bitcoin and Ethereum using 4477 Bitcoin's articles and 1221 for Ethereum. This analysis has the following components:

    * Sentiment Analysis: assigned positive, negative, and neutral sentiment scores from the articles. In this case, Ethereum had the highest mean positive score of 0.075, the highest compound score of 0.95, and the highest positive score of 0.32.
    * Natural Language Processing: in this section, I tokenize the text from the articles to clean and processed the text, then used NGrams and frequency analysis to find the top 10 most common words in the articles for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Finally, to visualized the articles content I used Word Cloud for each coin.
    * Named Entity Recognition: this model highlights key words among the articles such as organizations, companies, and numbers for both Bitcoin and Ethereum and indicated what which word represents.
